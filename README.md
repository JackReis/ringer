![Ringer — she reviews; the wall works](docs/hero.png)

**Parallel AI-agent swarms that prove their work. Your expensive model plans and reviews; cheap workers do the typing.**

Frontier models are finally good enough to trust with real implementation — but their tokens are priced like senior-engineer hours, and most of a build is not senior-engineer work. It's scaffolding, migrations, test suites, batch transforms. Mechanical labor.

So split the roles. Your best model writes the specs and reviews the results. A swarm of cheap workers — Codex, Grok, anything with a CLI — does the implementation in parallel. Your premium budget stops scaling with lines of code written and starts scaling with decisions made.

One problem: parallel agents lie. "Done" doesn't mean working. Ringer doesn't take the worker's word for anything — it **executes your check command** against the artifact. Pass or fail is decided by running the code, not by reading the agent's summary. Failures retry once with the failure context injected, and every attempt is logged so your setup gets measurably better over time.

And because a swarm you can't see is a swarm you don't trust: **Ringside**, a local web page every run opens automatically, showing every live swarm on your machine — who's running it, what each worker is doing, elapsed time, token burn — in real time, plus a versioned library of what past runs produced.

## How it works

```

                      ▼
              Ringside, in the browser (live, all swarms, all identities)
```

## Quickstart

Ringer runs on macOS and Linux (Windows via WSL) and needs Python 3.12+.

1. Install a worker CLI and sign in (Codex is the built-in default engine):

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex   # or: brew install --cask codex
codex login                    # sign in with your ChatGPT plan
```

2. Get the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/ringer && cd ringer
mkdir -p ~/.config/ringer && cp config.sample.toml ~/.config/ringer/config.toml   # optional — sane defaults without it
```

3. Teach your agent to route work through Ringer:

```bash
# optional but recommended: teach your agent to route work through ringer
./ringer.py install-agent
```

4. Run the demo:

```bash
./ringer.py demo                                      # 3 real workers, verified end to end
```

The demo spawns three Codex workers in parallel, verifies each artifact by executing it, and prints a verdict table — and Ringside, the live dashboard, opens in your browser on its own. If all three say PASS, that's the whole setup.

Run your own batch:

```bash
./ringer.py run swarm.json --max-parallel 4
```

```json
{
  "run_name": "my-batch",
  "workdir": "/tmp/my-batch",
  "max_parallel": 3,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "key": "alpha",
      "spec": "Create alpha.txt containing exactly: alpha ready",
      "check": "test \"$(cat alpha.txt)\" = \"alpha ready\"",
      "expect_files": ["alpha.txt"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each task gets its own directory, its own worker, its own log, and its own verdict. `check` is any shell command — exit 0 is the only thing Ringer believes.

> **Write checks that print why they fail.** A silent `exit 1` (the `git diff --quiet` style) costs you twice: the retry prompt gets no failure context to fix against, and the eval log records an undiagnosable row. `diff` beats `diff -q`; an assert with a message beats a bare test.

**Identity**: runs are stamped with an orchestrator identity (shown in Ringside and eval rows). Resolution order: `--identity` > `FLEET_IDENTITY`/`RINGER_IDENTITY` env > a `.fleet-agent` file found walking up from the working directory (drop one in a repo root to give that repo's swarms their own name) > `identity_default` in config > short hostname.

**Which host**: every new run snapshot under `~/.ringer/runs/<run_id>.json` includes `which_host`, exactly `aegis`, `talaris`, or `box`. Missing, empty, aliases, and hostname strings fail the run before a receipt is written. A Multica comment before done cites `runs/<run_id>` and `which_host` (optional prover tip). Host-craft receipts (`aegis`, `talaris`) cite registered-machine Shell; `box` stays Scratch in the stamp. Contract: [`docs/RECEIPTS.md`](docs/RECEIPTS.md).

**Scorecard**: `./ringer.py scorecard` is the weekly fail-closed gate for source-of-truth drift (`sot_drift`) and agent-memory freshness (`agent_memory_freshness`). Exit 0 is required before Multica done or soft-ship. Contract: [`docs/SCORECARD.md`](docs/SCORECARD.md).

### Manifest fields

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| `key` | Task name — becomes the working subdirectory and the label everywhere |
| `spec` | The prompt handed to the worker |
| `check` | Shell command run after the worker exits; exit 0 = PASS |
| `expect_files` | Files that must exist and be non-empty before the check runs |
| `engine` | Which configured engine runs this task (default `codex`) |
| `model` | Which model a harness engine runs for this task — fills the engine's `{model}` placeholder (e.g. `"openrouter/moonshotai/kimi-k2.7"`); empty uses the engine's `model_default` |
| `task_type` | Optional free-form string naming the kind of work this task is, so the model-performance log can slice pass rates by task shape rather than only by model. Suggested vocabulary: `code-feature`, `code-fix`, `code-review`, `test-hardening`, `docs`, `research`, `persona-review`, `copywriting`, `site-build`, `motion-design`, `image-gen`, `data-pipeline`, `format-conversion`, `probe`, `bakeoff`. Empty is allowed; the log just reports it under `(none)`. |
| `timeout_s` | Per-task kill timer (default 900) |
| `max_attempts` | How many times this task may run (default 2 — one try plus one retry with the check's failure output injected). Set `1` for a hard no-retry lane |
| `redact_spec` | Replace this task's spec with `[redacted request packet]` in the run state, the logged command line, and the eval row, for specs carrying sensitive material. Redacts Ringer's own records only — captured worker output is never rewritten (invariant), so a worker that echoes its request still puts that text in `worker.log` |
| `engine_args` | Extra CLI flags for this task's worker, spliced in at the engine's `{engine_args}` placeholder — e.g. `["-c", "model_reasoning_effort=low"]` so the orchestrator picks reasoning depth per task |
| `verified` | One plain-English sentence saying what the check proves — shown on the results page next to "finished & checked" |
| `full_access` | Worker runs unsandboxed — required for workers that spawn their own sub-workers; must also be enabled in config |
| `worktrees` (run-level) | Give each task an isolated git worktree of `repo` so parallel workers can't collide |
| `worktree_lfs` (run-level) | `materialize` (default) downloads/checks out Git LFS content normally; `skip` sets `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1` while creating worktrees. Use `skip` for code-only work in media repositories. |

> **Worktree footgun:** on PASS the task's worktree is removed — including anything written inside it. In worktrees mode, worker logs live outside task worktrees in `workdir/logs/`; have workers write deliverables outside the worktree too, or have your `check` copy artifacts out before it exits 0.
>
> Before any real run, Ringer checks the disk-pressure marker, requires at least 60 GiB or 15% free after projected worktree creation, and estimates projection from repository checkout size times task count. A rejected run records a local receipt and creates no worktree.

Not sure what your tasks even are yet? [`docs/interview-prompt.md`](docs/interview-prompt.md) is a prompt you paste into any chatbot; it interviews you about the job and hands back a brief your orchestrating agent can turn into a manifest. Ready-made skeletons for the patterns that work live in [`templates/`](templates/).

## `ask` — one bounded question, one clean worker

Not every question deserves a manifest. When you want a read-only answer over
source you can already point at, `ask` selects the passages that match the
request, caps the packet, and runs a single worker on it:

```bash
./ringer.py ask "Why did the Wednesday release slip?" --source notes/status.md
./ringer.py ask "..." --source src/ --source docs/ --dry-run   # show the packet, spend nothing
```

Repeat `--source` for more files or directories. `--state` takes a small file
of settled decisions and is preferred over ordinary sources when the packet is
tight. `--max-packet-bytes` sets the budget (default 16,000). `--dry-run`
prints the selection report and stops before any model call. `--redact` keeps
the request out of the run state and eval row. The run appears on Ringside and
in the artifact library like any other.

If everything that matches is too big for the packet, `ask` says so — naming the
budget you'd need — and stops **before** calling a model. It never sends an
empty packet. A source small enough to fit whole is included whole, whether or
not it looks relevant, so pointing `ask` at unrelated material still costs one
call: the packet is only as good as the sources you name.

Directory scans stay inside the tree you named. A symlink pointing out of it, or
one resolving to a sensitive filename, is skipped and reported. A file you name
explicitly is always read — naming it is consent.

> `ask` verifies only that an answer was produced and is non-empty. There is
> nothing to execute against free-form prose, so this is the one lane in Ringer
> where the check does not prove the result is right. Read the answer. Anything
> whose output a check could actually execute belongs in a manifest.

## Lint

Lint checks a manifest for the mistakes that make swarms hard to trust: checks that cannot fail, silent checks, worktree deliverables that disappear, worker commits that die with deleted worktrees, serial fan-out, write collisions, and underspecified specs.

```bash
./ringer.py lint templates/review-swarm/manifest.json
lint: clean (1 tasks)
```

`run` and `demo` also print any lint findings as non-blocking warnings after the manifest loads. They teach at the moment of use; they do not stop a run.

A check that cannot fail is trusting the worker with extra steps.

### Baseline: prove your checks before spending tokens

Lint reads the manifest; `--baseline` executes it — every task's `check` runs against the unmodified tree, spawning no workers and writing no eval rows:

```bash
./ringer.py run swarm.json --baseline
```

Each check runs in a fresh scratch dir (a detached worktree when the manifest uses worktrees) through the same verifier as a real run. Reading the results: an assertion that demands the NEW behavior workers will build is *expected* to FAIL baseline; an assertion about UNCHANGED behavior that fails baseline is a bug in the check itself, and at run time it would burn a worker's attempts against something no model can satisfy. Fix the check before spawning.

## Make your agent actually use this

Between swarms, agents drift back to invisible inline work. Reminders decay, so enforcement ships with the product.

Run one command:

```bash
./ringer.py install-agent
```

It installs the ringer skill — the orchestrator playbook — user-level for Claude Code, and registers two gentle hooks: a Bash hook that notices model-calling or harness commands running outside a live Ringer run, and an edit-loop hook that notices batch editing without a run. Each hook nudges ONCE per session, pointing the agent at the skill.

The hooks never block anything. A user who says "just do it inline" is obeyed; uninstall with `./ringer.py uninstall-agent`.

For CI and evals, `config.sample.toml` includes `[engines.mock]` so the enforcement stack can be tested without an API bill.

## Engines are pluggable

![Identical workers, each under its own light](docs/engines.png)

Ringer's primary text lanes are OAuth CLIs: **Codex CLI** for OpenAI,
**Claude Code** for Anthropic, and **Gemini CLI** for headless Google work.
`pi-openrouter` is the universal OpenRouter text API lane. Anything else with
a headless CLI is a config block away:

```toml
[engines.mymodel]
bin = "/usr/local/bin/mycli"
args_template = ["run", "{spec}", "--dir", "{taskdir}"]
```

Per-task `"engine": "mymodel"` routes work to it — the invariants (stdin closed, process-group kill, executed verification, raw logs) apply to every engine identically.

### Seedance video through OpenRouter

Ringer also ships a first-class `seedance` engine for OpenRouter's asynchronous Video API. It is a paid media-generation lane, not a Pi text model or catalog-only alias. See [Seedance video generation](docs/SEEDANCE-VIDEO.md) for configuration, manifest flags, auth resolution, cost metadata, and the checked asset-swarm example.

### Auth-first model routing

Ringer fails closed for native and OpenRouter text routes:

- Anthropic, Claude, Haiku, Sonnet, Opus, and Fable use `engines/claude-oauth.sh`. The wrapper clears inherited API routes, requires Claude Code to report first-party `claude.ai` authentication, normalizes supported family aliases, and forces safe mode without user/project/local settings.
- OpenAI, GPT, o-series, and Codex use `engines/codex-oauth.sh`. The wrapper clears inherited API routes, requires `codex login status` to report a ChatGPT login, and forces `--ignore-user-config`.
- Google and Gemini use `engines/gemini-oauth.sh` for machine-readable headless work. Installed Antigravity opens an interactive editor chat, so it is not the Ringer worker lane.
- Every exact lowercase `openrouter/<publisher>/<model>` text selector uses `engines/pi-openrouter-ringer.sh`. On Linux, the wrapper always launches Pi inside bubblewrap: only the task directory is writable at `/workspace`, `/tmp` is private, `/proc` is absent, and Pi receives no host home or repository mount. It does not mount `/usr`; it resolves `/usr/bin/node`, strictly validates its `ldd` dependencies and ELF interpreter, and mounts only that minimal runtime under `/runtime` plus narrow DNS, TLS, NSS, and time data. `/usr/local`, `/usr/src`, shells, and unrelated host files remain absent. The installed Pi package is read-only at `/opt`. Before scratch creation or auth access, canonical common-path checks reject task directories equal to, above, or below the Pi agent directory, including symlink aliases, and reject overlap with the installed Pi package. The wrapper creates a read-only ephemeral `/agent` containing only a one-model `models-store.json` whose provider, model ID, and `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` endpoint are validated and pinned. One Python supervisor opens and validates the literal source credential exactly once, pins that launch and redaction key in memory, injects it only as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in an explicitly constructed clean child environment, captures Pi directly, and redacts before the shell can read output. This removes the source-auth replacement race. No auth file is copied or mounted, and the key never enters Pi or bubblewrap argv. Global `models.json`, settings, extensions, prompts, and other agent state are neither copied nor mounted. Pi keeps the `read,write,edit` tools, while sessions, bash, extensions, skills, prompt templates, themes, and context files remain disabled. An exact credential match is redacted and fails the run with a generic error. Unsupported platforms, missing bubblewrap, malformed model cache, unsafe runtime dependencies, and unsupported Pi package layouts fail closed before invocation. Identity and accounting are verified before success markers.

Ringer validates the family-to-wrapper pairing before launch. Neither OpenCode
nor a custom engine can claim an OpenRouter text selector, even with
`auth_routing_trusted = true`. Legacy Z.AI Coding Plan validation remains for
older private configurations, but it is not an active sample default.

```bash
codex login
claude auth login
gemini                  # complete Gemini CLI OAuth
# Configure OpenRouter in ~/.pi/agent/auth.json for explicit API work.
# Refresh Pi's OpenRouter model cache before an offline Ringer run needs a new
# exact model; Ringer will not fetch or infer a missing cache entry.
```

Route Anthropic with `"engine": "claude"`, OpenAI with `"engine": "codex"`,
and Google with `"engine": "gemini"`. API fallback is explicit: the manifest
must select `"engine": "pi-openrouter"` and name the exact OpenRouter selector.
There is no automatic cross-engine failover, so an OAuth failure cannot silently
incur API spend.

### The plan lane: Grok Build CLI

If you already pay for SuperGrok or X Premium Plus, Grok Build is a second flat-rate worker lane — no per-token bill:

```bash
# 1) Install (pick one)
curl -fsSL https://x.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
# or: npm install -g @xai-official/grok

# 2) Sign in — OAuth on a SuperGrok or X Premium Plus plan
grok login

# 3) In ~/.config/ringer/config.toml, uncomment [engines.grok]
```

Route with per-task `"engine": "grok"` and pick the model with `"model": "grok-build"` or `"model": "grok-composer-2.5-fast"` (the shipped default — the speed pick). Grok brings its own OS sandbox on macOS (profile `workspace`: read everywhere, writes confined to the task dir, temp, and `~/.grok`), and its JSON output exposes no token counts — plan-billed workers report cost as included in plan.

`args_template` is an argv array, not a shell string. Ringer replaces `{taskdir}`, `{spec}`, and `{model}` inside each argv element. `{access_args}`, `{sandbox_args}`, `{full_access_args}`, `{model_args}` (becomes `-m <resolved model>` when the task or engine names one), and `{engine_args}` (the task's per-task `engine_args`) expand to multiple argv elements only when they appear as their own array item.

Watch for variadic CLI flags. If an engine has a flag that consumes all following values, put `{spec}` before that flag. For Claude-style CLIs, prefer:

```toml
args_template = ["-p", "{spec}", "--allowedTools", "Bash"]
```

not:

```toml
args_template = ["-p", "--allowedTools", "Bash", "{spec}"]
```

Each worker process runs with cwd set to `workdir/<task.key>/`. Use absolute paths in `spec` when workers need shared inputs outside their task directory.

## Ringside — mission control

![Ringside in the browser: a run's live results page with per-worker status and verification](docs/ringside.png)

Ringside is a local web page — no install, no account, nothing leaves your machine. Your first run opens it automatically; every later run streams into the same tab:

```bash
./ringer.py run manifest.json   # starts Ringside and opens the tab for you
./ringer.py hud                 # or open it any time → http://127.0.0.1:8700
```

The top of the page is the run's live results document: what the job is, a progress bar of rounds, and "The work" — every deliverable each worker filed, with a plain-English line saying what the check proved and the raw check output one click away. Below it, the agents: expand a worker to see the exact brief it was handed, which engine and model are typing, and its live work stream. Past runs stay in a versioned library, and a swarm whose orchestrator *died* without finishing gets its own unmissable state — the failure mode every dashboard forgets.

Multiple swarms at once is the designed-for case: run three batches under three identities and Ringside shows all three, live. `--browser` opens a simpler per-run fallback dashboard, and `--no-dashboard` runs headless.

A native desktop build (Tauri, under `hud/`) exists as a v0.1.1 prototype; the web dashboard is currently ahead of it — start there.

## Self-update

Ringer checks `origin/main` at process start, before it dispatches the requested command. Checks are throttled to once per hour by default. You can also run `./ringer.py self-update` for an immediate, human-readable check that ignores the throttle.

An automatic update applies only when the checkout containing `ringer.py` is on `main`, has no tracked changes, and `origin/main` can be reached with a fast-forward-only update. Untracked files do not block it. After applying, Ringer restarts the original invocation so the requested command runs on the new code.

Ringer never creates a merge commit, never rebases, never stashes or deletes changes, and never updates a dirty tracked tree. Regular commands do not update in the middle of a run: their only check happens at process start before dispatch.

The persistent `hud` command is the exception for long-running code. It checks on the configured interval and restarts itself after an ff-only update. It also restarts when the checkout's on-disk HEAD changes after a manual pull. Before restarting it closes the HTTP server, whose socket is configured for immediate reuse. If an update is available but blocked, Ringside keeps serving the running code and shows the reason in a dismissible banner.

Disable automatic checks for one invocation with `--no-self-update`, for an environment or service with `RINGER_NO_SELF_UPDATE=1`, or permanently in config:

```toml
[update]
auto = false
check_interval_s = 3600
```

## The eval loop

![Timed, verified, logged](docs/eval-loop.png)

Every worker attempt — pass, fail, timeout, retry — is logged with its spec, engine, duration, token count, and the raw check output. Local JSONL by default; point `[eval.postgres]` at a database to aggregate across machines. Failure rows are the point: they tell you which spec styles, engines, and task shapes actually work, so the swarm gets better on evidence instead of vibes.

## Multica Judge receipts (fleet)

When `MULTICA_ISSUE_ID` is set (e.g. `AEGI-78`), Ringer posts **one** Multica
comment after Judge rows are written to `~/.ringer/runs.jsonl`. Implementation:
`hooks/multica_receipt.py` (called from `RingerRunner` post-run). Comment-only —
does not wake Multica agents. Fail-open: a Multica outage never flips PASS→FAIL.

| Env | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `MULTICA_ISSUE_ID` | Owning issue; required for posting |
| `RINGER_MULTICA_RECEIPT=0` | Disable posting |
| `RINGER_MULTICA_RINGSIDE_URL` | Override Ringside URL (else Tailscale HUD, or `ringside: withheld-stale` if ledger >48h) |

Idempotency ledger: `~/.ringer/receipts/multica-posted.json`. The SAFE-NOW shell
wrapper (`ringer-with-receipt`) remains backward-compatible until PATH cutover;
see `CUTOVER.md`. Fleet-internal fork — PolyForm Shield still applies; do not
publish as competing SaaS.

## Model performance log

### Model identity taxonomy

The scoreboard keeps the trained model, its lab, the invoking harness, the access plan, and any explicit reasoning effort as separate fields. Reserved test names never render, and historical rows without a stamped model are quarantined instead of being credited to an engine default. Models with a declared canonical access route are enforced at lint and run time — a manifest that reaches a model through a non-sanctioned harness/slug is refused unless you pass `--allow-noncanonical-route`, and historical rows from such routes display as `misrouted` and are never ranked. See the normative [model identity taxonomy](docs/TAXONOMY.md).

Every task attempt is logged **automatically and locally** to `~/.ringer/runs.jsonl` — no setup, no account, nothing leaves your machine. Each row carries the per-attempt verdict straight from the EXECUTED check, plus duration, tokens, the resolved `model`, the task's `task_type` (if the manifest set one), and the `retry` number.

Read it with:

```bash
./ringer.py models          # per-(model, task_type) scoreboard across the local log
```

The scoreboard reports, per model and task_type: tasks, attempts, `pass_rate`, `first_try_pass_rate`, median duration and token count, and `last_seen`. The signal for routing is `first_try_pass_rate` — the share of tasks that passed on attempt 1 without a retry; `pass_rate` is the rescued rate after Ringer's single retry, so the gap between the two is the cost of the retry lane. Slice the log with `--log` (a different JSONL), `--task-type`, `--model`, `--engine`, `--since`, or `--json` for piping elsewhere.

History from before the `model` / `task_type` / `retry` columns existed can be seeded in one pass:

```bash
./scripts/backfill_model_log.py \
  --log ~/.ringer/runs.jsonl \
  --runs-dir ~/.ringer/runs \
  --mapping mapping.json
```

The `--mapping` file joins old log rows to a `task_type`. Each line uses one of three key forms, applied in order:

- `run_id:task_key` — names one task in one run (most specific).
- `run_id` — names every task in that run.
- `name:prefix` — names every task whose key begins with `prefix`, across all runs (least specific, the usual way to cover a whole kit's keys).

Rows that match nothing keep their old `task_type` (empty); rows whose run-state JSON can't be found keep their old `model`.

`docs/MODEL-NOTES.md` is where the human-readable judgment lives on top of these numbers — the scoreboard tells you the pass rates; the notes tell you why a model shines or chokes on a given task shape.

### Evidence-based routing

The scoreboard only knows models you've already run. To reason about models you *haven't* tried yet, Ringer keeps a local snapshot of the OpenRouter catalog and a change log alongside the runs log:

```bash
./ringer.py catalog                  # fetch/refresh ~/.ringer/openrouter-catalog.json
```

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--refresh` | Force a re-fetch even if the snapshot is fresh |
| `--source URL_OR_PATH` | Pull from a non-default URL or local file instead of the live OpenRouter API |
| `--file PATH` | Read a catalog document you already have on disk, no network |
| `--free` | Filter to models with a $0 price — promo models included |
| `--changes` | Print the recorded add/remove/price_change/went_free/went_paid events from `.changes.jsonl` |
| `--json` | Emit the snapshot (or, with `--changes`, the event log) as JSON for piping |

The snapshot lives at `~/.ringer/openrouter-catalog.json`; the change log sits beside it as `~/.ringer/openrouter-catalog.changes.jsonl`, appending one row per added, removed, price-changed, went-free, or went-paid event between snapshots. Free promos get their own call-out (`went_free`) because a temporarily-free model is a zero-cost experiment — the cheapest way to audition a new model is to catch it while someone else is paying for it.

Catalog fetches are throttled to once per 24 hours. A `run` triggers that refresh in the background on its way up; it never blocks or fails a run — if the fetch is slow or the network is down, Ringer carries on with the snapshot it has. The throttle and the auto-refresh-on-run are both documented in `./ringer.py run --help` and can be turned off there.

Once you have a catalog and a log, `models --explore` joins them into a routing recommendation:

```bash
./ringer.py models --explore                 # tiers across all task types
./ringer.py models --explore --task-type docs # tiers for one task shape
```

Models with local evidence are sorted into tiers:

- **proven** — 3+ tasks of this `task_type` logged, with `first_try_pass_rate >= 0.67`. The lane you trust with heavy work.
- **probation** — some attempts logged but not enough volume or not enough first-try passes. Use it; don't lean on it.
- **untested** — nothing in the log yet. Pulled from the catalog: text→text, 32k+ context window, up to 10 candidates, FREE models first then cheapest. These are your audition queue.

The promotion ladder is the point. A model enters as **untested**. You spend a small slice of suitable runs — about one task per run — auditioning cheap or free candidates on small, low-stakes work where the executed check is strong and the single retry absorbs the failure: docs sweeps, mechanical edits, persona reviews. While evidence accumulates the model sits on **probation**. At 3+ tasks with `first_try_pass_rate >= 0.67` it's **proven** for that task type and earns a lane on the heavy work. The recommendation flow is the same one this ladder implies: exploit proven models for the load-bearing tasks, and keep spending that small slice auditioning untested candidates so the bench refills itself.

The per-user philosophy, stated plainly: every user's workload is different, so the scoreboard learns what works for *your* tasks on *your* machine. A model that's proven in someone else's log is untested in yours until you've run it. The numbers are not portable between users, and the routing recommendations get personal as the log grows — which is exactly why the catalog and the change log stay local and the explore tiers are computed from your own `runs.jsonl`, not from anyone's aggregate.

## Steering profiles

Ringer can optionally load per-model steering profiles, prepend applicable worker rules to both first-attempt and retry prompts, print driver guidance for the orchestrator, and collect one local observation row per attempt. The feature is fail-open: missing or malformed steering data never blocks a run. Setup, the profile contract, and the observation schema are documented in [`docs/STEERING.md`](docs/STEERING.md).

## Hard-won invariants

Four rules are baked into every worker invocation. They all cost us real debugging hours; you get them for free:

1. **stdin is always closed** (`< /dev/null`) — headless CLI agents hang forever waiting on a TTY that isn't there.
2. **Sandbox mode is always explicit** — default sandboxes silently resolve to read-only in temp directories and block every artifact write.
3. **Verification executes the artifact** — an agent's own "done" is not evidence. Exit codes are.
4. **Raw output only** — logs and eval rows carry verbatim worker output, never a summary. Anything that needs judgment reads the raw data.

Contributions are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the philosophy and what gets a PR merged fast. The short version: small and scoped, rebased on current main, every claim backed by an executed test. Authorship is always preserved — where a maintainer pushes a mechanical fix to your branch, you remain the commit author.

## Preflight: Ringer engine-bin gate

Before dispatching any swarm, verify every configured engine's `bin` is actually
present. **Never** substitute `which <engine>` for availability — it false-negatives
when the engine lives in a PATH dir omitted from the default shell (e.g. `~/.local/bin`),
which can wrongly force a `delegate_task` fallback. The gate resolves each
`[engines.NAME].bin` directly from `config.toml`:

```bash
bash "$(pwd)/scripts/verify-ringer-engines.sh" <config.toml>
# or probe a host without a preflight abort:
python3 scripts/ring-engine-probe.py <config.toml>
```

Routing policy: **native Ringer first** (Aegis `codex`/`opencode`/`hermes`/`kimi`, then
Talaris `claude_code`/`codex`); `delegate_task` only after the probe proves no native
engine is available, and always logged as an explicit fallback. See the fleet routing
decision record at `=notes/docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-16-aegis-ringer-routing-decision.md`.

## License

[PolyForm Shield 1.0.0](LICENSE.md) — free to use, modify, and share, including inside your own commercial work. The one thing you can't do is offer Ringer or Ringside (or a derivative that competes with them) as a product or service of your own. Commercial rights to the tool itself belong to Nate Jones Media LLC.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+ (stdlib only; `psycopg` needed only for the optional Postgres eval backend)
  - **Changed:** the supported floor moved from 3.11 to 3.12. CI has only ever run 3.12, so 3.11 was a promise nothing enforced — the honest fix is to state the version we actually test. Today's code still happens to run on 3.11; that is no longer guaranteed, and 3.11 breakage won't be treated as a bug.
- At least one agent CLI (Codex works out of the box)
- Rust toolchain, only if you're building Ringside from source

Built by [Nate Jones](https://natejones.com) and maintained by [LEJ](https://limitededitionjonathan.com) — a Claude orchestrator wrote the specs and reviewed the diffs, Codex swarms wrote the implementation, and this repo's own eval table caught its first three bugs. The tool is its own proof of concept.
